To install all dependencies run `carthage bootstrap --platform ios`.

## Work in Progress

This project is work in progress. Because of this, the documentation is laking (as usual), and the architecture is not as clean as I would like it to be.

If you want to contibute but don't know where or how to start, feel free to contact me.

This project uses [git flow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) as the branching model.
